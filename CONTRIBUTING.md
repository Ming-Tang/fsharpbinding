* [F# mode for Vim](https://github.com/fsharp/vim-fsharp)
* [F# mode for Sublime Text](https://github.com/fsharp/sublime-fsharp-package)
* [F# mode for Atom](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharp.Atom)
* Shared backend component [FsAutoComplete](https://github.com/fsharp/FsAutoComplete)
* [Monodevelop/Xamarin Studio support](https://github.com/fsharp/xamarin-monodevelop-fsharp-addin)
